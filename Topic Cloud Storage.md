what we learned in the last class?

ESR: We learned about functions. We also learned about functions defined for file object and use them to manipulate text inside files

Libraries in python are called Modules. We will learn how to import modules into our project and use them in programming. We will learn about two specific modules - os module and shutil module. At the end of the class, we will have built two python tools which will automate - backing up any folder which we want. - organizing different kinds of files - images, videos, songs into separate folders

What is a cloud storage service? 

A remote storage space which allows us to store our files remotely. These storage spaces allow us to access data from anywhere and from any device

r, in the last class we had progressed to create backup for our files. But we were backing up on our own system in a different storage location / drive

Let us learn to write a python program which backup any file we want on a cloud storage service/ We will be using a popular cloud storage service called DropBox.
